## Issues, risks and decisions

"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." - Carl Jung.

It is the active process of taking action and monitoring that matters, but the first step is capturing and tracking issues.  Without action you just have 'feel good' ceremonies.



#### Issue log

You may already have a IT system for tracking issues, the key thing here is that you have a process and a scope for the the issues.  e.g project issues, product issues, organisational issues and that these issues are escalated if they are at a level where the person being affected by it, cannot resolve it.  Its important to have a clear owner for an issue.

#### Decision log

| 1 | Should we use Kanban as the workflow to manage software delivery | Scrum, **Kanban** | Work is consistent and priority is changing frequently.  Two weekly sprints are inefficient in this context. | 7/09/2020 | Bob Smith |
