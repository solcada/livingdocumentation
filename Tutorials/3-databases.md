## Databases

Your organisation is going to have systems of records.  They are databases, fileshares, blob storage where information is persisted.
Start anywhere and capture a list of Databases at your organisation.

We are capturing logical definitions only.  You might have 1 or more copies of database in each one of your logical environments but we only need to document it once.
